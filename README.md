# Spring Boot with Docker

This repository demonstrates how to containerize a Spring Boot application using Docker. It includes a step-by-step setup, a `Dockerfile`, and optional `docker-compose.yml` for orchestrating multi-container environments.

## Features
- Containerized Spring Boot application.
- Simplified deployment and scalability.
- Example `docker-compose.yml` for multi-container orchestration.
- Multi-stage Docker build support for optimized image size.

---
## Getting Started
This project uses Docker to run a Spring Boot application in a containerized environment. Follow the instructions below to build and run the application.

---
## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (for building the application)

---
## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
[git clone https://github.com/Mr-Chandan-Prasad/Spring-Boot-With-Docker-By_Mr_Chandan.git)
```

### 2. Build the Application
Use Maven to build the Spring Boot JAR file.

#### Using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

The JAR file will be generated in the `target/` directory (Maven) or `build/libs/` directory (Gradle).

---

### 3. Build and Run with Docker

#### Build Docker Image:
```bash
docker build -t spring-boot-docker .
```

#### Run the Container:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-boot-docker
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

### 4. Using Docker Compose
For projects that require multiple services (e.g., database, cache), use `docker-compose`.

#### Build and Start Containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start both the Spring Boot application and any dependent services (e.g., MySQL).

---

## Best Practices
- Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker build context.
- Use multi-stage builds in the `Dockerfile` to optimize image size.
- Externalize configurations using environment variables or configuration files.
